Yes we broke the world record! [Firefox was downloaded 3 8,002,530 times ](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080702-mozilla-sets-guinness-world-record-with-firefox-3-launch.html)Ars Technica reports. Guinness records manager Gareth Deaves stated:
\> As the arbiter and recorder of the world's amazing facts, Guinness World Records is pleased to add Mozilla's achievement to our archives. Mobilizing over 8 million internet users within 24 hours is an extremely impressive accomplishment and we would like to congratulate the Mozilla community for their hard work and dedication.
I for one downloaded it 6 times! 1 on my eee pc, 1 on my desktop, 2 times on my dual boot computer at work, and 2 times on my brother's dual boot desktop. Not to mention the 6 or 7 colleagues of mine who I encouraged to download it! So here my pat on the back ![:)](http://192.168.1.2/blog2/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
