Since this is a \*Linux advocacy\* blog, it's only normal for me to share with you guys my favorite list of \*Linux\* commercials. I love these because of the deep messages and meanings behind each of them:
\#\# 1-Float Like A Butterfly
Muhammed Ali and \*Linux\* have many things in common, his quick fists and swift feet are akin to \*Linux\*'s flexibility and speed. Ali is the greatest boxer in history, and to me, \*Linux\* is the greatest OS! Indeed Ali claimed he is the greatest boxer, and he is probably right about \*Linux\* also. Watch the great legend promote openness:

\#\# 2-Novell Knows Spoofing
I know I know, we all grew bored of these "I am a Mac I am a PC" commercials, but you gotta admit they are quite clever. Here are two from Novell

\#\# 3-Then Linux Wins
A strong message, and true in every sense.

\#\# 4-IBM: The New Allie

\#\# 5-The Boy Has Been Adopted
