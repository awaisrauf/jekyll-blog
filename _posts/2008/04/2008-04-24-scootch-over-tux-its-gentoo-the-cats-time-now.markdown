In a recent blog post of mine, [Etymology of A Distro](/blog/linux-general/etymology-of-a-distro/), I mentioned that I convinced a friend to name her cat "Gentoo". And since we all know that the Internet is basically built on \[tubes and cat pictures\]\[1\], I decided to treat it as a dump truck and load all the Gentoo The Cat pictures! Watch out, your "internets" will get delayed by a few more seconds.
Oh while we're at it, these pictures will be sooner or later be featured in a LOLcats design somewhere, so please do share them with me ![:)](http://192.168.1.2/blog2/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
