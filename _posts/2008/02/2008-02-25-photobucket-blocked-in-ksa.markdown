Yesterday Pakistan's government figured that youtube is the devil incarnate and decided to [totally shut it off](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7261727.stm "totally shut it off"). This caused a shockwave of controversy all over the Internet; [digg](http://digg.com/world_news/Pakistan_blocks_YouTube "digg"), [reddit](http://reddit.com/info/69thb/comments/ "reddit"), [stumbleupon](http://www.stumbleupon.com/url/news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7261727.stm "stumbleupon"), and various forums where all up in arms. To make things worse, a Pakistani ISP decided to reroute all the youtube traffic to some other website which brought [youtube to it's knees](http://blog/s.zdnet.com/threatchaos/ "youtube to it's knees"), everybody's favorite video site was inaccessible globally! ![:(](http://192.168.1.2/blog2/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif)

Today, another web 2.0 website was sucked up by the Middle East censorship blackhole. I woke up today going through my usual routine of checking the rss feeds of [Digg](http://www.digg.com "Digg") and [Mixx](http://www.mixx.com "Mixx"). A front page story on Digg was a picture on [photobucket](http://www.photobucket.com "photobucket"), so I unwarily click on the link. [Photobucket](http://www.photobucket.com "Photobucket") is service I have used many times, and I am very familiar with. Lo and behold, some jack ass over at the the ever-esteemed "censorship" agency decided that [Photobucket](http://www.photobucket.com "Photobucket") is inappropriate for 25 million people and with a myopic sense of judgment pulled the plug on it! Just like that!

I wasn't going to sit idle like that and see some foolish decision like that implemented on a whole nation. I contacted them, and here is what I had to say:

> This is a photo hosting service that I have been using for years now in Saudi Arabia, why has it been blocked? I understand that some might misuse it in pornography and what not, but photobucket has a policy against that and IS moderated. I just don't understand why block a totally legitimate website just because a few 5% minority might be "misusing" it. Please Unblock it!

Let's wait and see what happens!!
