Ahhh, the wonderful stuff you can find on [DeviantArt](http://www.deviantart.com/)! This one is brought to you by [~Gegege-no](http://gegege-no.deviantart.com/). It's a girl riding a [GNU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU) with [Tux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux) wielding a Quake blaster. I really like the subtlety of the Ubuntu imagery: only a portion of the Ubuntu logo appears on the girl's forehead and Ubuntu colored beads in her hair. Maybe ~Gegege-no should submit this picture to the [Ubuntu Karmic Koala wallpaper contest](/blog/eye-candy/ubuntus-karmic-koala-needs-you/)?
