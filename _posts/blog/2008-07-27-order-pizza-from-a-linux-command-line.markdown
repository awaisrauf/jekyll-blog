Linux beginners are usually advised to learn the command line, or at least I usually pass out that advice. There is probably nothing you can't do using a terminal, you just need to know what you are doing. Hell you can even order your own Pizza!
\[Cory Arcangel\]\[1\] and Michael Frumin created a Linux command line app to help you order from Domino's called [Pizza Party](http://www.beigerecords.com/cory/pizza_party/). Here are some important points about the app:
\* Can order pizza with only a few keystrokes.
\* Can save pizza preferences.
\* Can use batch files for ordering many pizzas.
\* Has easy to use flags for ordering different toppings.
\* Runs on most UNIX-like operating systems.
\* Supports most currently popular topings like "mushrooms", and "pepperoni"!
\* Unattended / background operation.
\* Pizza Party is distributed under the \[GNU General Public License\]\[2\].
Here is the app in action:
