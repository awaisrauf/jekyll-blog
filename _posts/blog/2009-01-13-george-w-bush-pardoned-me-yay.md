<span style="font-family:Times;">January 13, 2009</span>
  
<span style="font-family:Times;">I, George W. Bush, President of these United States of the Americas, pursuant to that pardon power thingy conferred upon me by Article II, Section 2, of that Constitution I keep hearing people go on about, have granted and by these presents do grant a full, free, and absolute pardon unto Rami Taibah &mdash; or as I like to call him, Squeege Butt &mdash; for the crime of high treason.</span>

The aforementioned &mdash; not to mention the beforementioned &mdash; shall not be subject to any punishment for this crime, including imprisonment in a high security prison, Chinese water torture or waterboarding. Well, maybe a little bit of waterboarding, but just for fun, ya know? Heh heh.

Being The Decider in Chief, I have hereby used my Decidering powers to declare that Rami Taibah is a faithful devotee of Zoroastrianism and is, as such, a technically decent but godless citizen of this great nation. To punish this person would embolden our enemies abroad for some undefined reason.

In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand today, on January 13, in the year of our Lord 2009 &mdash; which I totally cannot believe is actually here, and I still haven&#8217;t gotten my hovercraft &mdash; and of the Independence of the United States of America.

God bless,
  
George W. Bush
