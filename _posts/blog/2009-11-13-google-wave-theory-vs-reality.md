    A can really relate to this. Was fighting for an invite, and when I finally got one, I had no one to &#8220;wave&#8221; with! Had to dig up public waves to find uses of the services, which just cramped up my inbox. Luckily, I got 28 invites which I gave to friends.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    TBH, after using the service, the excitement quickly wore off. But I son&#8217;t write it off just yet for two reasons:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    1-Wave is still crude, and still in it&#8217;s beta stage. <br />2-Will wait until its public roll-out to see how it goes from there
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Remember, Twitter seemed stupid in the beginning, but people found creative ways to use the service. I am crossing my fingers that Wave will be the same.
