Recently [Martin](http://www.matusiak.eu/numerodix/blog//) shared with me a Reddit comment thread titled [What would the best geek epitaph be?](http://www.reddit.com/info/6ofbu/comments/). This immediately caught my attention, as the question posed is fertile for outrageous humor, witty comments, and downright geeky cheekiness. Here are some beaming examples:
\* \*\*"Goodbye World"\*\* ; coders start out their programming careers with the "[Hello world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program)" program, it's only appropriate for them to end it with this one!
\* \*\*"Respawn in 10... 9... 8..."\*\*; for the geek gamers out there
\* \*\*"shutdown -h now"\*\*; self explainable, but the -h flag is for halt. 
\* A user brilliantly replied to the above epitaph with \*\*"shutdown -r now if he is a Buddhist"\*\*; the -r flag means reboot. Reincarnation.
\* \*\*"Hashes to hashes, struct to struct."\*\*
\* \*\*"404 Life not found"\*\* 
\* \*\*"rm -rf /dev/body mv /dev/soul ../\*\*"; rm is the Unix command for "remove", mv is for "move", -f for "force", -r for "recursive"
\* A screen shot of a\*\* "[BSOD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Screen_of_Death)" \*\*
\* \*\*$\>[/dev/null](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NUL_%28Computer%29)\*\*
I also took the liberty of googling some more, here are some other great examples:
\* \*\*"Born: 1337 Died:1337â€³\*\*
\* \*\*"Pwned"\*\*; obvious but classic!
\* \*\*"OMG H4x"\*\*
\* \*\*"Damn Lag"\*\*
\* \*\*"LAST POST!"\*\*
\* \*\*"Exceeded TTL"\*\*; TTL= [Time To Live](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TTL)
\* \*\*"EPIC FAIL"\*\*
\* \*\*"Fatal Error" 
(A)bort, (R)etry, (I)gnore?

\* \*\*"It's not a bug, it's a feature."\*\* Now thats just class! 
Pictures are worth a 1000 words:
