Its been a year since I started blogging at <a href="http://hehe2.net" target="_blank">hehe2.net</a>. Over there I usually write about Linux and Open Source, one of the greatest passions in my life. Half way through the year I decided to keep hehe2.net a Linux and Open Source blog. But this kinda raised a problem: With my vast knowledge in every F&#8217;ing field I am bound to have something to share with this world. So I decided to install WordPress as a subdomain to my <a href="http://ramitaibah.com" target="_blank">lifestream</a> (ramitaibah.com).

Stay tuned here for my latest news, rants, and wisdom-ness&#8230;
