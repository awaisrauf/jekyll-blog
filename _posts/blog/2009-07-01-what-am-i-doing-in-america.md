<p style="text-align:justify;">
  Its been almost 3 month since I moved from Saudi Arabia to Boston to prepare for my grad school studies. And in any social event I attend I am asked by people about what is I do. Saying &#8220;grad student&#8221; immediately elicits the &#8220;what school?&#8221; question. Usually, it isn&#8217;t enough for me to say that I am preparing for grad school.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  To people here, potential grad students have jobs while preparing their college applications and study for whatever standardized test required for acceptance. Nobody simply &#8220;prepares for grad school&#8221; and does nothing else.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  So let me explain. I am here on a governmental scholarship program sponsored by the Ministry of Higher Education. The Ministry is sponsoring thousands of Saudi students each year most of which aren&#8217;t really fluent in English. So, the Ministry requires all students to take a year of English courses (since they don&#8217;t want to listen to each individual case.) In this year, students are expected to:
</p>

  * Learn English
  * Get a good score in the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)
  * Get a good score in GMAT,GRE&#8230;etc
<li style="text-align:justify;">
  Get an acceptance in a good school
</li>

Luckily for me, my English is good, and I got docked 8 points out of 120 in the TOEFL (Harvard requires a 110 score.) So I&#8217;m left with the GRE exam and ultimately an acceptance at a good school.

Currently I am going to an English school in the morning to fulfill my I-20 Visa requirements, and going to start a GRE course at Kaplan in July.

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  Needless to say, this leaves me with a lot of free time on my hand. So what do I do during this free time? Well that requires a blogpost on its own!
