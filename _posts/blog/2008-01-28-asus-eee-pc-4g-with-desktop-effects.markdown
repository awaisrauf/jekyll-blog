[Last month](/blog/gadgets/eee-pc-8g-at-newegg/ "Last month") I reported that the Asus eee pc 8G is available at[Newegg](http://www.newegg.com "Newegg") and that I already placed an order. Well it turns out the [Newegg](http://www.newegg.com "Newegg") sucks!! They cancelled my order because apparently they [don't accept international](http://www.newegg.com/Info/FAQDetail.aspx?Module=2&Menu=detail167%23xdetail167 "don't accept international") American Express cards! Now I would've understood if the shipment was international, but it wasn't! It was supposed to be shipped to NY, to a legal address registered under my credit card! This is 2008 [Newegg](http://www.newegg.com "Newegg") !
One of the reasons that I opted for [Newegg](http://www.newegg.com "Newegg") was because I wanted the 8G model which comes equipped with 1 GB of RAM and an 8GB SSD hard drive, and that model was (and still) scarce. Now there is nothing wrong with the 4G model which is already available at [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Asus-4G-Galaxy-Mobile-Internet-Preloaded/dp/B000Y33CVM/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1201492502&sr=8-1 "Amazon"), but the fact that it has only 512MB of RAM was kind of a turn off. However I stumbled on to this video just now which just might change my mind ![:D](http://192.168.1.2/blog2/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif) !
