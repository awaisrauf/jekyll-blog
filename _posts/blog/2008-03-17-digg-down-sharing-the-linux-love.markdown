Digg went down today! But that's not what really intrigued me. Digg had a "We'll Be Back Shortly" page with a recommended website from each staff member, but if you look closer, you will also see the Digg logo on the top and what seemingly is a server and a pixelated Debian logo!! This is the first time I witness a Digg downtime, so it might not be news, but for me it is! Was it done on purpose? I don't know. But it was obviously sloppily done!
In other news, I wonder what new features will they be adding now ![:P](http://192.168.1.2/blog2/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif) ?
