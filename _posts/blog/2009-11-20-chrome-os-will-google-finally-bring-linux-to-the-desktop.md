    Maybe. Maybe not. Though I have concerns of Google owning everything now. Imagine this project succeeds and millions upon millions have their data in Google&#8217;s cloud. They already have a huge amount of data on most of us, throw in all my activity on an OS, and you got a new and very frightening hegemony.

    In any case, I welcome anything that would take away from the *other* hegemony ðŸ™‚
