    I want this phone. I want it now! I find the wireless charging functionality is a killer here, its probably technically possible too. The keyboard would also be very cool, a bit gimmicky though.

    Sadly, we won&#8217;t be seeing this anytime soon, from Mozilla at least. From their FAQ:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <h4>
      Does Mozilla have plans to produce a mobile phone?
    </h4>
    
    <p>
      No. Mozilla produces Firefox for Mobile, the popular Firefox browser for mobile phone systems such as Nokia Maemo and Android. You can find out more about <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/mobile/">Mozilla Firefox for Mobile here</a>.
