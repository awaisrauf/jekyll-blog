      <p>
        Sony Ericsson has unveiled the release date for its first-ever Android device &ndash; the Sony Xperia X10.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Expected to hit stores 10 February 2010 &ndash; <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/sony-ericsson-unveils-the-android-xperia-x10-646383">as predicted by TechRadar earlier this month</a> &ndash; the Xperia X10 is certainly well-equipped for Google&#8217;s OS.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Sporting a 1GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, it will be the speediest Android-infused handset on the market and one which is also packed with some mouth-watering features.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Feature focus</strong>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        These include an LED Flash &ndash; which will hopefully follow in the HTC HD2&#8217;s footsteps and be as bright as the sun &ndash; automatic face-tagging, an 8MP camera and a 4-inch WVGA screen.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Oh, and it will be packing Android 2.0, so expect Google Navigation and the like.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Couple this with a 3.5mm headphone jack and a new overlay which will give user a new way to search on the phone, and it sounds like Sony has come up with a real contender in the burgeoning Android market-place.
      </p>

    This might cancel my Droid plans. Always been a fan of SonyEricsson before Android coming to the scene. Is this a perfect marriage?

    Wish it had a physical keyboard though&#8230;.
