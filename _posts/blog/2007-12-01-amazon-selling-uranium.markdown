Seems like there is nothing you can't buy off the Internet these days. Apparently the good fellas at \[Amazon.com\]\[1\] are selling \[Uranium ore\]\[2\]! Yes you heard it U-R-A-N-I-U-M! You know the stuff that would bust your balls.
[![Uranium on Amazon.com](/blog/wp-content/imagescaler/356ffb9827efa8eb1cf8644a14e73c7c.png)](http://www.amazon.com/Uranium-Ore/dp/B000796XXM "Uranium on Amazon.com")
Maybe Bush should bomb \[Amazon.com\]\[1\] instead of Iran? ![:D](http://192.168.1.2/blog2/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif)
Anyways I did some research about this, since "Uranium Ore" is not exactly "Pure Uranium". Plus I doubt that \[Amazon.com\]\[1\] would market such a thing (not that the authorities would let them anyways).
Uranium ore or Uraninite is a mineral that is mainly composited of UO2 or Uranium Dioxide. Pretty much like CO2 but with a Uranium atom instead of a Carbon atom. But it also contains smaller traces of UO3 and Oxides of Lead and Thorium and some other rare minerals. Uraninite helped \[Marie Curie\]\[3\] discover Radium.
Uraninite is very radioactive, which still doesn't answer my question about how could \[Amazon.com\]\[1\] advertise such a thing? The \[US Postal Service \]\[4\]has Urininite under the "Hazardous, Restricted, and Perishable" category. Which means that it's legal to ship it, but thats probably just for research purposes and what not.
\*Edit: [Peter Rost](http://peterrost.blogspot.com/2007/11/amazoncom-sells-uranium.html) noticed a very disturbing thing. Apparently people who bought Uranium ore from Amazon, have very weird fetishes that only Uranium can complement ![:D](http://192.168.1.2/blog2/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif)\*
