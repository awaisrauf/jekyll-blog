After a \[very\]\[1\] \[arduous\]\[2\] journey, I finally got my hands on the highly coveted \[eee pc\]\[3\]. I managed to get a 4G model, upgraded to 1GB ram and an 8GB sdhc card for $555 off \[ebay\]\[4\]

Anyways, only minutes after firing it up I realized that the easy mode is not for me, so I needed to get out of my captivity. I just fired up a terminal (CTRL-ALT-T), updated apt, and then: 
\`\`
\`sudo apt-get install ksmserver kicker\`
I got my beautiful \[Xandros\]\[5\] desktop, but thats about IT!!

I soon found that the Xandros repos are pretty much useless, no Kopete, no Yakauke, no Abiword and the network manager sucks! Now I am sure there are ways to getting these apps to work, but like the old saying goes: You can't teach an old dog new tricks. So I decided to explore greener pastures. I am downloading eeexubuntu as I type this. A full review and howto will soon ensue. Stay tuned!
