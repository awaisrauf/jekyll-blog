After a very [arduous](/2007/12/11/eee-pc-8g-at-newegg) [journey](/2008/01/28/asus-eee-pc-4g-with-desktop-effects), I finally got my hands on the highly coveted [eee pc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus_Eee_PC).

Anyways, only minutes after firing it up I realized that the easy mode is not for me, so I needed to get out of my captivity. I just fired up a terminal (CTRL-ALT-T), updated apt, and then: 

    sudo apt-get install ksmserver kicker

I got my beautiful [Xandros](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xandros) desktop, but thats about IT!!

I soon found that the Xandros repos are pretty much useless, no Kopete, no Yakauke, no Abiword and the network manager sucks! Now I am sure there are ways to getting these apps to work, but like the old saying goes: You can't teach an old dog new tricks. So I decided to explore greener pastures. I am downloading eeexubuntu as I type this. A full review and howto will soon ensue. Stay tuned!
