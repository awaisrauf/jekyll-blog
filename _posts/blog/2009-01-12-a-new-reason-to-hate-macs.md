  In numerous occasions, I have made it publically clear that I hate Apple and Macs. I made it publically known to my friends, giving them snarky remarks, or just condescending looks when they prance around with their iPhones and iMacs. I also made it publically known to the whole world, on my <a href="http://hehe2.net/thedarkside/iphone-3g-a-beautiful-jail/" target="_blank">Royal HeHe2-ness blog</a>.

  However, my brother Obai (or oobi) owns a Macbook Pro, he came back to Jeddah for his wedding, and I ended up using his Mac since my PC (Ubuntu) stopped working for some hardware failure. No biggie, I think I can handle it.

  So am browsing, blogging, Digging&nbsp; you know doing my thing. And I wanted to refresh a page and clear it&#8217;s cache. In any normal OS, I would simply hit CTRL+F5, and that would do the trick. But NOOOOOOOOOOOO, Apple must have a different way to do it, after all their motto is (was?) <em><strong>&#8220;think different&#8221;</strong></em>
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  CTRL+F5 didn&#8217;t cut it, nor did Apple+F5, nor did Apple+Ctrl+F5. So I ended up mashing all the these buttons + F5. Shift, Alt, Ctrl, Apple, Tab you name it. Nothing worked.&nbsp; Finally decided to clear the whole browser&#8217;s cache from Firefox&#8217;s Tools menu. I thought my problems were over, boy was I wrong! One of the combination I hit, enabled a very cool function that I wish every OS had. A robot saying everything I do! Maximize, minimize, widget, new window, a, e, u, semi-colon&#8230;..argggggh FUUUUUUUUUCK. Here listen for yourself:

  Ya I know its an accessibility function for the visually impaired, but still this is confusing as hell!
