I want this phone. I want it now! I find the wireless charging functionality is a killer here, its probably technically possible too. The keyboard would also be very cool, a bit gimmicky though.

Sadly, we won't be seeing this anytime soon, from Mozilla at least. From their FAQ:
  
    Does Mozilla have plans to produce a mobile phone?
    
    No. Mozilla produces Firefox for Mobile, the popular Firefox browser for mobile phone systems such as Nokia Maemo and Android. You can find out more about [Mozilla Firefox for Mobile here](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/mobile/)></a>.
