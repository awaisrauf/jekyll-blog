Asus eee pc 8G is now available on [newegg](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834220264 "newegg") !! This little devil is all you need for your mobility needs! It's only 7 inch and weighs only .9 kg (2 pounds)! While packing 1 GB RAM and a 8 GB solid state disk! And of course it runs Linux! Wooohooo!
Just ordered it from [newegg](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834220264 "newegg"), I even chose overnight shipping, I just can't wait to get my hands on it.
