Am malnourished! Well not really, but I almost never have time to have breakfast before I go to work. I should be at work 8:30, on a good day, I wake up 8:15! Luckily we have a Starbucks in our building, so that kind of solves the breakfast problem (despite the fact that their food sucks).

Anyways two of my colleagues and I have a habit of going down to Starbucks 2 or 3 times a week. Yesterday I summoned them for Starbucks. This time they retorted &#8220;Israel are killing Palestinians in Gaza, and you want to go eat at Starbucks!.&#8221; They went on to explain that Starbucks officially provide aid to Israel and their CEO. Who was this CEO? They didn&#8217;t know of course that his name is Howard Schultz because they were just parroting some viral E-mail almost everybody in the Arab world got a couple of years ago. Its almost a fact that Howard Schultz publicly bragged about his support to Israel and that Starbucks sends millions among millions to Israel.

While this has \*some\* truth to it, but the facts are severely twisted. My colleagues were basically referring to a speech where Howard Schultz extols the company&#8217;s contribution to Israel. I knew that this was not true, but rather that this speech was a <a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/israel/schultz.asp" title="spoof by some blogger" target="_blank">spoof by some blogger</a>. I made that clear to them&#8230;.

I went on and asked one of the guys what brand of cigarettes he smokes. He took his Carlton&#8217;s victoriously out of his pocket and shouted &#8220;British! Not American&#8221;. I was like &#8220;Hello? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration_of_1917" title="Balfour" target="_blank">Balfour</a>? Who planted Israel in Palestine in the first place?&#8221;

What about the English Premiership League? The one you so fanatically watch and follow? Chelsea&#8217;s owner is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Abramovich" title="Roman Abramovich" target="_blank">Roman Abramovich</a> is a Jew. Arsenal used to run &#8220;Israeli Tourism&#8221; ads a couple of years ago. And am sure that your favorite club Manchester United has some &#8220;Jewish blood&#8221; on their hands. He strongly denied it, and proclaimed that Manchester United is &#8220;clean&#8221;.

So I turned back to my laptop, determined to find a Jewish link. Gave it a little thought, and remembered that that Manchester&#8217;s owner Malcolm Glazer could be very much Jewish. A Google-second later confirmed my suspicions. He is Jewish! So I quickly wrote up an E-mail asking him to boycott Manchester since their owner is Jewish, and that every minute you watch them playing is another bullet donated to Israel.

Pheeew! I know that there are a lot of sweeping statements and generalization in all of my arguments. First off Jewish doesn&#8217;t equal Zionist, but I was just using their same logic and mentality. And guess what? it worked!

Once I confirmed that he read my E-mail, I turned and said over my shoulder, &#8220;I expect you to stop supporting Manchester tomorrow&#8221;. That didn&#8217;t really sit well with him, &#8220;of course not! Manchester is in my veins!&#8221;. I told him that would make him a hypocrite, you can&#8217;t condemn me for something you yourself do!

He stormed out and left&#8230;..
