Us Linux users are very passionate about our operating system. We get into flame wars with others, push it down other's throats ([which we don't condone](/blog/advocacy/help-spread-linux-without-preaching-it/),) [blog about](/blog/general/30-blogs-every-open-source-enthusiast-should-keep-an-eye-on/), [work feverishly in converting](/blog/linuxhumor/howto-convert-a-friend-to-linux/), and finally "vandalize" our cities.

Here are 13 Linux and Open Source graffiti art I found on the Interwebs. I tried to figure out where each was, but for some I just couldn't find any info. So if you happen to know where one is located or know of any other cool graffiti, please leave a comment.
\#\# 1-IBM's Peace, Love, Linux

![Peace-Love-Linux-IBM](http://192.168.1.33/blog2/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Peace-Love-Linux-IBM.jpg)

[IBM's Peace, Love, and Linux](http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/industry/04/19/ibm.guerilla.idg/index.html) advertising campaign, sidewalk graffiti, observed on April 20, 2001 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
\#\# 2-Born To Be Root

![Born-to-be-root](http://192.168.1.33/blog2/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Born-to-be-root.jpg)
Our bird mascot gives Microsoft The Bird! I would really love to know where this piece of art is.
**Update:** Felis in the comments notes: "must be somewhere in Sweden. The text at the left -- "Jag lÃ¤sar din e-mail"  means "I'm reading your e-mail"  :-)"
\#\# 3-Linux Starts Now

![Linux-Graffiti-Microsoft-Vista](http://192.168.1.33/blog2/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Linux-Graffiti-Microsoft-Vista1.jpg)

This one was seen in the Toronto subway only days after the the Microsoft Vista launch.
\#\# 4-Obey: Tux

[![Obey_Linux_by_simpletoker](http://192.168.1.33/blog2/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Obey_Linux_by_simpletoker.jpg)](http://192.168.1.33/blog2/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Obey_Linux_by_simpletoker.jpg)

Based on [Shepard Fairey's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_Fairey) famous Obama HOPE poster, comes this Tux graffiti ([original artwork](http://simpletoker.deviantart.com/art/Obey-Linux-130855300)). Though it still hasn't graced our streets, the artist behind it [intends to do so](http://simpletoker.deviantart.com/art/Obey-Linux-130855300). Can you beat him to it?
\#\# 5-Linux Punx

![Linux_Punx](http://192.168.1.33/blog2/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Linux_Punx.jpg)

Linux Punx -- Hardcor3 -- 1337 -- g33k....nuff said!

## 6-We Do Linux

![We-Do-Linux-Graffiti](http://192.168.1.33/blog2/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/We-Do-Linux-Graffiti.jpg)

This can be seen in Australia,   which is apparently an ad for [cybersource.com.au](http://cybersource.com.au) a leading Linux and open source solutions company.

## 7-Cron!

![cron_graffiti_med](/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/cron_graffiti_med-1024x768.jpg)

Found this on [svana.org](http://svana.org/sjh/diary/2007/05/21#2007-05-21_01), without the context behind this one, it would appear as kiddie scribbles:

> I was interested to see this on the Braddon Telstra building yesterday. Graffiti artists are getting into unix in a big way when they feel the need to pledge their support for the unix command scheduler on the side of buildings.
> 

> Of course I guess, as it was on the side of the Telstra building, it may be some statement about how telstra is run, all from a series of [cron jobs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron). That may actually explain a lot about the organisation if you give it some thought.

## 8-Freedom Fighters

![Tux-Graffiti-Linux2](http://192.168.1.33/blog2/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Tux-Graffiti-Linux2.jpg)

This one comes from Netherlands, according to Google Translate it says:_"fight for" something (I am assuming freedom here), "stop prohibition"_ Maybe one of our readers can help? ![:)](http://192.168.1.2/blog2/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif) [Xen](http://twitter.com/xen_yasai) in the comments translated this to: "Fight for your right to housing. Stop squatting prohibition."

## 9-Tux on Rails

![Tux-on-rails](http://192.168.1.33/blog2/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Tux-on-rails.png)

This one is on one of Chicago based TTX railcars, needless to say its traveling around the country.

## 10-IE Sux? Yeah It Does!

![Internet-Explorer-Error-Graffiti](http://192.168.1.33/blog2/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Internet-Explorer-Error-Graffiti.jpg)

Well not exactly Linux related, but we love poking fun at Redmond don't we? IE fail graffiti, lovely!

## 10-Tux of Torino

![Tux-Graffiti-Linux](http://192.168.1.33/blog2/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Tux-Graffiti-Linux.jpg)

This one is in Torino, Italy. The hometown of my beloved [Juventus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C.). I'll probably go findthis one on my next footballing adventure ![:)](http://192.168.1.2/blog2/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)

## 11-Pinguino Urbano
