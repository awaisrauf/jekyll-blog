  I love Tweetdeck. Its my main Twitter client on all Desktop (Seesmic on mobile.) The ability to display columns is really a killer feature. Two years ago, I would&#8217;ve been more than happy with 3 or 4 lists. But with the huge explosion of Twitter in the past year, content on Twitter also experienced a huge increase. A &#8220;Technology&#8221; list just doesn&#8217;t cut it anymore, today I find myself wanting to create &#8220;Open Source/Linux,&#8221; &#8220;Security,&#8221; and &#8220;Social Media&#8221; lists. The only problem is that any given screen would fit about 4.5 columns. As a result, I would have to scroll horizontally (the worst kind of scrolling) for any lists beyond the 4th list.

  Wouldn&#8217;t it be amazing to have the ability (doesn&#8217;t have to be the default) to split the columns into half columns? Something like this:
</p>

<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
  <a href="http://139.59.20.41/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/screenshot.png"><img alt="Screenshot" height="333" src="http://139.59.20.41/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/screenshot.png?w=300" width="500" /></a>
</div>

What do you think? What other solutions could Tweetdeck implement to enhance the column experience? Any thoughts?
