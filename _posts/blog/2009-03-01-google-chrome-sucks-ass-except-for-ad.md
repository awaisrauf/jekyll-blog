With much fanfare, Google released their browser, Chrome, sometime ago. Understandably the Internet went into a frenzy, after all Google are the gods of the Internet. The excitement soon wore off, well at least for me, first there was no Linux or Mac versions and the usability was simple and utter crap. Firefox still reigns supreme. But hey at least this Chrome ad kicks Ass!
