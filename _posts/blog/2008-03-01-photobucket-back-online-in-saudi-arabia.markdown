Last week I \[reported\]\[1\] that Saudi Arabia has blocked \[photobucket\]\[2\] for some peculiar reason. This censorship coincided with Pakistan's blocking of youtube. Anyhow I am happy to inform you that \[photobucket\]\[2\] was unblocked today. Did my E-mail resonate with the authorities? I really don't know. I would like to think so! But in any case I am sure am not the only one escalated the issue.
