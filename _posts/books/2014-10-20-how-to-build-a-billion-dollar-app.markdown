Chapter 1: The View From The Inside
===================================

Introductory material. Generics. Nothing really to extract

Chapter 2: Mobile Genetics
==========================

This chapter goes through the history of computing and the evolution from desktop computing to mobile computing.

Some Mobile Stats
-----------------

- The number of mobile phones exceeded the number of people today: 7 billion!

- The number of smartphone users will exceed 1.75 billion in 2014.

- In 2013 people spent $25 billion on apps - a 62% increase on 2012.

- Smartphones are 15 times faster than the Cray-I (1979)

- Smartphones users are spending 2 hours and 38 minutes a day on their phones (17%)

- The most popular revenue stream for mobile apps are paid-for apps, followed by in-app purchases (projected to equal paid for in 2017,) then advertising which is miniscule (10%-15%)

Apps Make Us Feel Good
----------------------

In 2013, Facebook conducted a study. Smartphone users were asked "How do social and communication activities on smartphones make you feel?" The two strongest sentimets expressed were 'connected' and 'excited.'

Leading apps capitilised on this by focussing on design, usability, performance and things like the tone of voice used in their copy.

A 2013 study by Harris Interactive found that 75% of people are always within 5 feet from their phones, and 10% have used one during sex.

Chapter3: A Billion Dollar App
==============================

Human Universals
----------------

According to Dr. Donald Brown from the University of California, there are 67 human universals that all people share:

> Age grading, athletic sports, bodily adornment, calendar, cleanliness training, community organization, cooking, cooperative labour, cosmology (study of the universe,) courtship, dancing, decorative art, divination (predicting the future,) division of labour, dream interpretation, education, eschatology (what happens at the end of the world,) ethics, ethno-botany (the relationship between humans and plants,) etiquette, faith healing, family feasting, fire making, folklore, food taboos, funeral rites, games, gestures, gift giving, government, greetings, hairstyles, hospitality, housing, hygiene, incest taboos, inheritance rules, joking, king groups, kinship nomenclature (the system of categorising relatives,) language, law, luck superstition, magic, marriage, mealtimes, medicine, obstetrics, pregnancy usage (childbirth rituals,) penal sanctions (punishment of crimes,) personal names, population policy, postnatal care, property rights, propitiation of supernatural beings, puberty customs, religious rituals, residence rules, sextual restrictions, sould concepts, status differentiation, surgery, tool making, trade, visiting, weather control, and weaving.

If your idea resonates with a human universal will maximize the appeal of the app. This is a good checklist and worth checking to see if you can match apps that correspond to each one.

150 Times A Day
---------------

*Tomi Ahonen* publishes the Mobile Almanac, and according to his research, people check their smartphones 150 times a day. Here how it's broken down:

**1- Messaging, 23 Times Per Day:** Facebook, Google, Tango, Whatsapp, Viber, Snapchat.

**2- Voice-Call-Related, 22 Times Per Day:** Skype, Viber, Google Hangouts.

**3- Clock, 18 Times Per Day:** Huge market opportunity. No killer clock app yet.

**4- Music Player, 13 Times Per Day:** Discovery, purchacing, playback. Tricky market because of record labels. iTunes, Pandora, Spotify.

**5- Gaming, 12 Times Per Day:** Huge potential. Tricky because very competitive and gamers higher standards. Candy Crush, Angry Birds, Clash of Clans, Hay Day.

**6- Social Media, 9 Times Per Day:** Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. Very hard to break into now, with all the different integerations these apps have on mobile and desktop.

**7- Alarm, 8 Times Per Day:** Big opportunity. No killer app. iOS alarm clock is good enough?

**8- Camera, 8 Times Per Day:** Oversaturated market. Over 5000 apps in the Apple's App Store. But fast-changing, might have a billion dollar app in the near future.

**9- News and Alerts, 6 Times Per Day:** Massively fragmented. But Flipboard.

**10- Calendar, 5 Times Per Day:** This space is crying for attention. Nothing really stands out here (from a mobile perspective.)

**11- Search, 3 Times Per Day:** This refers to actualy searching content on the phone. Difficult to compete with native OS search.

**12- Other Random Web Browsing, 3 Times Per Day:** How will this evolve? How will future browsers challenge current?

**13- Charging Phone, 3 Times Per Day:**: Nothing in terms of software/apps. For now.

**14- Voicemail, 1 Time Per Day:** Meh. Spinvox ended in tears after burning through $100 Million.

**15- Misc. 10 Times Per Day:** What new markets/ideas are here?

Sharing Big
-----------

People love to share. It gives us a small jolt of dopamine everytime we share according to Diana Tamir and Jason Mitchell of Harvard.

Companies that leveraged sharing: Instagram. Groupon took something that is not inherently shareable and capitalized on social media.

Saudis lead the chart with over 60% of its population share. The world population is 23%. China at 33%. While the USA at 15%.

Disruption Comes in Many Flavors
--------------------------------

It's about being innovative, fresh, and disruptive. Taking it to the next step. Mere enhancements won't cut it, as current apps are already well positioned to do that. Look for the WOW factor. Captivate your audience with your wow.

Chapter 4: It's Bloody Hard
============================

> 0.07% of funded startups become billion-dollar companies

What about the other 99.3%? Here you go:

- **11% Exited Startups:** Average successful startups raised $41 million at a valuation of $242 million. There is a coorelation between amount of money raised and value at exit. Suggesting that raising more money indeed creates more value. *(Me: coorelation does not mean causation)* Here is how they exited:

     - *By getting acquired*: Raised $29.4 million and sold for $155.5 million. It takes an average of 7 years to build a company to this level.

     - *By IPO*: Raised $162 million and generated $467.9 million in IPO. It takes an average of over 8 years to build a company to this level

- **25%-30% Complete Failure:** i.e liquidation

- **40%-50% Just Barely:** Profitable enough to keep going, but not enough to be aquisition targets.

*Of all startups, 60% make it to 3 years old, and only 35% make it to 10 years old.*
