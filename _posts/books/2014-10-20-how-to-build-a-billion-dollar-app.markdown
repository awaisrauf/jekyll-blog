Apps Make Us Feel Good
----------------------

In 2013, Facebook conducted a study. Smartphone users were asked "How do social and communication activities on smartphones make you feel?" The two strongest sentimets expressed were 'connected' and 'excited.'

Leading apps capitilised on this by focussing on design, usability, performance and things like the tone of voice used in their copy.

A 2013 study by Harris Interactive found that 75% of people are always within 5 feet from their phones, and 10% have used one during sex.
